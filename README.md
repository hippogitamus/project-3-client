# Project 3 client

# Application Title: A Description

This application was built to address one of the biggest questions of our day: Where's the party?

Moreover, this single page application allows the user to create a party, update a party, delete a party and RSVP to a Party.

### Planning Story

Our team, comprised of Caley Bennett, Ryan Patel, Simon Gigli and Nina DeSimone
utilized the agile project planning framework. As a team, we began our planning
process with whiteboarding which lead to wierframing and scheduling our three
project days. To make sure that we met requirments, we divided the group into
groups and parsed out the work load for both backend and frontend between each
group. Following the division of work, Caley and Nina set out to create the
skeleton of the API while Ryan and Simon create a bare bones front end.
